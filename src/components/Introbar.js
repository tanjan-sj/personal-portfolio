        An avid learner who loves to explore new technologies. Interested in
        problem solving, building new stuffs and making my life easier with bits
        of code and automation. In the span of my 2+ yrs of professional career,
        I have experience on working in the FinTech industry and for offshore
        clients. I have an assortment of experience for a career so short (till
        now) where I had the opportunity to build my expertise on requirement
        engineering, designing scalable system, and of course - adapting to new
        technologies right away! I learn from my failures and that's where my
        interest in research comes from.
