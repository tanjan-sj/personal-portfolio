  intro: `Hey there! I'm Jannat.`,
  introParagraph: `In a childhood filled with world classics and fictions, I was intrigued
  when I finally got my hands on a scifi novelette I still treasure - The
  Bicentennial Man by Isaac Asimov. <br />
  Children want to be a lot of things when they grow up, and I was no
  exception; I had a hard time choosing my career between a wide range
  from an ice cream seller to an astronaut. <br />
  At the end of high school, I finally knew what I wanted to be - a
  researcher in the Computer Science field; because well, that's where the
  fiction in science truly takes place. <br />
  From making simplistic robots in my undergrad years to building industry
  grade applications in my current professional career, I aspire to make a
  dent in the technology sphere with my research and creativity.`,
